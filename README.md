## üìñ Project Description

This project investigates the use of acoustic representations for the automatic classification of Cognitive 
Impairment (CI) and depression within CI populations, with a specific focus on identifying and quantifying demographic 
and clinical biases in model performance.

We compare traditional acoustic features (MFCCs, eGeMAPS) against transformer-based embeddings (Wav2Vec 2.0) for CI and
depression detection using classical machine learning classifiers. Beyond overall performance, the project conducts bias
analysis across age, gender, and depression status, highlighting fairness concerns in speech-based clinical models.

Key components include:

- Performance benchmarking across imbalanced, CI-balanced, and CI-gender balanced datasets.
- Layer-wise analysis of Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings.
- Subgroup-wise bias quantification in CI classification outcomes.
- Cross-condition generalization experiments between CI and depression tasks.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Extract Features:**
- Run `src/wav2vec.py` to compute Wav2Vec 2.0 hidden layers embeddings.
- Use `src/acoustic_feature_extraction.py` to generate pickle file of all features i.e., MFCC, eGeMAPS and Wav2Vec 2.0.
2. **Evaluation and Bias Analysis:**
- Run `src/acoustic_classification.py` to evaluate classifiers for  CI vs. NCI and D-CI vs. ND-CI and subgroup performance evaluations.
3. **Customize Experiments:**
- Edit filepaths, configurations, and hyperparameters in scripts.
- Specify alternative dataset, seeds, features, models parameters, or data splits.

## üîÑ Reproducibility

To reproduce the reported results:

- Use the dataset filename lists in data/dataset_filenames.xlsx
- Use the same fixed random seeds: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 for data splitting.
- Refer to the scripts for exact configurations and hyperparameters.
